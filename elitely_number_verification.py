This program should be used to cross-check the backend database to see if the user has registered a phone number
If a phone number is found and retrieved, it should be saved as "USER_PHONE_NUMBER" 
The number will be used to allow users to start successfully receiving notifications
If no number is found, the value will remain null and the user will be directed to register a phone number

Note: Code for database phone number retrieval has to be written according to main backend repo (ex. MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc..)
